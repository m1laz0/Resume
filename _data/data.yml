career-profile:
    title: Summary
    summary: |
     Highly adaptable and open to learning diverse technologies to enhance job performance and contribute to organizational success. 
     In my spare time, I actively participate in collaborative endeavors aimed at tackling challenges by reviewing and making contributions to code repositories, all while concurrently engaging in personal project development.
     I usually use OpenAI and online documentation to experiment with code snippets and full logic to locate optimal solutions while cultivating a natural comprehension of data types and system components from the wide range of data provided.
     I take pleasure in crafting documentation, such as knowledge bases, readme files, and spreadsheets, as a means to preserve valuable knowledge for future reference. 
     My approach prioritizes simplicity and precision, ensuring accessibility and clarity in all documentation.
     In addition to my software skills, I maintain a typing speed of approximately 30 words per minute with an accuracy rate of 95%.
