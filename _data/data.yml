    summary: |
       Hi there! I'm Mike, I work with programming languages everyday and like to learn everything I can about data processing to increase my overall knowledge. I personally use languages like Python for general projects and machine learning, JavaScript for anything that has to do with web development, 
       and C# for more graphical intensive applications. I enjoy the challenge of problem-solving and try to incorporate math into my side projects even though I'm not the greatest at it. My skills can be useful in fields such as software development, web development, data science, data entry, 
       and anything regarding software really. I have understanding of user experience design and creating engaging interactions which can be applied to user interface design or product design. I have experience with project management and working collaboratively on a team.
       I'm excited to bring my enthusiasm, creativity, and technical skills to your organization and contribute to your projects' success.
