    title: Summary
    summary: |
     Highly adaptable and open to learning diverse technologies to enhance job performance and contribute to organizational success. I currently use OpenAI and online documentation to experiment with code snippets and complete logic, striving for optimal solutions while cultivating a natural comprehension of data types and system components.
     My most recent toolkit includes Unity for interactive mechanics, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Blender, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, Notepad++, and more. I excel in crafting user-friendly documents such as knowledge bases and readme files, aiming for simplicity and precision to ensure accessibility.
     In addition to my software skills, I maintain a typing speed of approximately 30 words per minute with an accuracy rate of 95%.
