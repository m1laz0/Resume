    title: Summary
    summary: |
    Hi there! I'm Mike, I work with computational linguistics everyday as personal hobby and like to learn everything I can about data processing to increase my overall knowledge. I personally use languages like Python for general projects and web development, 
    and C++ for more graphical intensive applications. I have understanding of user experience design and creating engaging interactions which can be applied to user interface design or product design. I have experience with project management and working collaboratively on a team.
    Highly motivated individual with a diverse skillset seeking employment in any industry.
